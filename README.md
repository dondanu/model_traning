This HTML page integrates a Teachable Machine image classification model with a webcam. Here's a summary of the key components:

1. HTML Structure:
A title and a "Start" button to initialize the webcam and model.
A container (#webcam-container) for displaying the webcam feed.
A container (#label-container) to show the predicted class labels and their probabilities.
2. CSS Styling:
Basic layout styling to center the content and provide modern visual effects.
Button with gradient background and hover effects.
Webcam container and label container styled with borders, shadows, and responsive features.
3. JavaScript Functionality:
Model Loading:

The model and its metadata are loaded from a specified URL (URL), which should point to the folder where the Teachable Machine model files (e.g., model.json and metadata.json) are hosted.
Webcam Setup:

A webcam feed is set up and displayed within the #webcam-container.
The webcam canvas is used for image predictions by the model.
Prediction Loop:

The predict() function is called continuously to analyze the webcam image, and the predictions (class labels with probabilities) are displayed in the #label-container.
4. External Libraries:
TensorFlow.js (tf.min.js) for handling machine learning models in the browser.
Teachable Machine Image Library (teachablemachine-image.min.js) to load and interact with the Teachable Machine image model.
How it works:
When the user clicks the "Start" button, the webcam is activated, the model is loaded, and predictions begin.
The model processes each webcam frame and classifies the objects, showing the predicted labels and their respective probabilities on the webpage.
This code provides a simple interface for running an image classification model in real-time using a webcam, powered by Teachable Machine.
